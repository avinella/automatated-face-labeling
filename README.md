# Comparing Deep Learning Models for Automated Facial Labeling
CS153 Final Project

This project compares the accuracy of three deep learning face detection models, a Haar cascade classifier, a Multi-tasking cascade convolutional network (MTCNN), and RetinaFace, on short film clips. These were run on the XSEDE bridges2 supercomputer on 2 GPUs. For both space and copyright purposes, the original clips as well as their separated frames are not included in this base, but select example annotated clips and frames are included.

The documentation for the specific implementation of each model can be found at these links:
- [Haar cascade classifier](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html)
- [MTCNN](https://pypi.org/project/mtcnn/)
- [RetinaFace](https://github.com/serengil/retinaface)
